# Astro Minimal Template

Yet another Astro.js template. No default pages or UI components, just base config to improve the developer experience so you can start your projects without worrying about extra steps.

## Features

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
- TypeScript and biome to improve code quality and prevent bugs throughout the project.
- lefthook to run automations on certain Git commands and force following standards.
- GitHub Actions workflows to automate project management.
- Minimal helper libraries
- Astro.js Sitemap integration
- Astro Favicon integration
- Astro Robots.txt integration

## Motivation

When starting a project, you always have to spend time installing and setting up the libraries that help manage the project before even dealing with the UI and business logic. So I created this template with all the basics to help you get started faster. It is strongly inspired by [Obytes's React Native template](https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes/tree/master), which I recommend visiting even if your project is not React Native.

## Considerations

The project is intended to be used with the `pnpm` package manager.

## Installation

Run the command:

```bash
pnpm create @pkcarreno/create-astro-minimal@latest
```

And follow the instructions.
